# 🌀 Zelonis Blockchain

Zelonis is a high-performance, modular, next-generation Layer 1 blockchain protocol built to support decentralized applications at internet scale. It introduces **PoToS (Proof of Time over Stake)**, a novel consensus mechanism that blends the economic security of PoS with time-based commitment to enhance fairness, sustainability, and performance.

## 🧬 Overview

Zelonis aims to solve the scalability trilemma — decentralization, scalability, and security — by integrating innovations across consensus, networking, and virtual machine layers. Its protocol is optimized for:

- High-throughput use cases (DeFi, real-time gaming, supply chain, AI compute)
- Sustainable long-term validator participation
- Instant finality with deterministic block production
- Parallel execution and stateless validation

> Zelonis combines time as a cryptographic resource with stake-based validation for a secure, permissionless consensus that rewards long-term commitment over short-term capital shifts.

## ✨ Key Features
✅ 100,000+ TPS via state sharding and parallelism
⛓️ Finality in seconds, not minutes
🔐 Slashing for malicious validators and downtime
🌱 Green consensus with no mining required

## 📜 PoToS: Proof of Time over Stake
PoToS innovates by factoring time into the consensus equation.

## 🧠 Core Concepts
Stake Weight: Validators stake ZEL to participate
Time Weight: Validator uptime and continuous participation are rewarded
VDF Ticks: Verifiable Delay Functions used for randomness and fairness
Epoch Rotation: Validators rotate each epoch based on time-weighted randomness

## 🛡️ Benefits
Prevents stake centralization
Discourages fast churn and "flash" validators
Encourages long-term ecosystem alignment
